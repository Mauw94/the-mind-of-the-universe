The universe is such an intriguing and existential-crisis inducing phenomenom. I love reading and learning about the vast amount of space and time that lies beyond our own world.

Why did the universe even start in the first place? What created the first matter that eventually caused the Big Bang? Is there an end to the universe? Why is it so unimaginably vast? Will we ever find life on another planet, will other life find us first?

There are so many questions. All the greatest minds of our Earth try to answer these very questions, but with no difinite answers, yet.

But I'm hopeful for the future, looking at the technological growth of the last 20 years, there is a big chance we will at least get an answer to some of these questions, in our lifetime.
