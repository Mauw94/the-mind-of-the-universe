# the-mind-of-the-universe

The universe is such an intriguing and existential-crisis inducing phenomenom. I love reading and learning about the vast amount of space and time that lies beyond our own world.

Why did the universe even start in the first place? What created the first matter that eventually caused the Big Bang? Is there an end to the universe? Why is it so unimaginably vast? Will we ever find life on another planet, will other life find us first? What exactly is dark matter, dark energy? Could a black hole be a gateway to another universe? Will it ever be possible to travel at the speed of light?

There are so many questions. All the greatest minds of our Earth, past and present, try to answer these very questions, but with no difinite answers, yet.

If all the military budgets in the world would be spent on the advancement of us, the human species, we would get somehwere, faster. Quite literally. I guess we're not that advanced yet after all. 
But I'm hopeful for the future, looking at the technological growth of the last 20 years (e.g James Webb Space Telescope, new moon missions, ..), there are so many new opportunities for new discoveries and knowledge to be found. And maybe, hopefully, answers to the above mentioned questions.
